# Compose-App

Simple Compose App is a basic Android application built using Jetpack Compose. It displays a list of items in a LazyColumn, and when a user clicks on an item, a Toast message appears showing the selected item. This project demonstrates fundamental Jetpack Compose concepts, including Composable functions, lists, click interactions, and Material Design components.

Features:
